Refer to https://github.com/dchu26/Telegram-Conversation-Demo for details on how to sign in on Telegram API and create your bot using the bot token and username; How to upload to Google Spreadsheet in Google Cloud.

The link for our created bot is https://t.me/networky_intro_bot 

## Bugs/Future fixes:
- Currently, you are only allowed to run the bot once. If you attempt to run it twice, even if you restart it without it finishing, the bot will not answer you back once it gives you the option to type your first name. The trade-off to this, for now, was the bot being able to work for multiple people at the same time.
- The Google spreadsheet makes a brand new sheet every time it updates rather than storing past information and adding to it.
- Find the best way to host?
